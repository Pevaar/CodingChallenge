## Take Home Coding Challenge

Welcome to our code challenge. This is your time to shine and show off your skills!

## First of all, here are the rules:

  1. You have **8 hours to finish the challenge**, starting right after allowing you access to this repository.
  2. Please **don't commit to this repository directly**, please **create a new branch** and push all your work there.
  3. You're allowed to use any internet resource to help complete the challenge. Be ready to discuss your code once it's finished.
  4. Use the following technology stack alternatives to build the app (**feel free to add any other library both on UI or backend to make your devlopment easier/faster**):
      * ASP.Net MVC 5, ASP.NET Razor (Front-End), SQL Server Express/MySQL (Database)
      * ASP.Net Core MVC 2.x, Angular 2+/React (Front-End), SQL Server Express/MySQL (Database)

## Now, let's have some fun! Here are the details of your challenge:

### The plot

  Carl has several Peruvian food restaurants and he wants to understand his clients preferences better so he can take decisions on how to evolve his business. Thus, he needs your help to create a **brand-new web application** to register all the orders and its details so he can establish a pattern of preferences on those orders.
  
### The requirements

  1. Design and implement a database that holds the following information:
      * Information about the restaurants, including restaurant's address and number of tables.
      * Information about the order, including the client's Name, Gender and Age. Also the restaurant that received the order, the dish ordered, date and time of the order.
      * Details of the dishes, including price, dish name, full description of the dish and ingredients used.
  2. Build a page to **register all the restaurants**. Here the user can add a new restaurant with its information and it can see the existing restaurants in a grid. . The grid should include the following columns (with example data): 
  
      Address | Number Of Tables
      --- | --- 
      Boulevard St. 45 | 15
      Ocean Av. 38 | 21
      
  3. Build a page to **add dishes**. This page will allow the user to add new dishes with their details. Also it can see a grid with the list of all dishes. The grid should include the following columns (with example data):
  
      Dish Name | Ingredients | Full Description
      --- | --- | ---
      Ceviche | Fish, lime, lemon, onion, chili pepper | Ceviche, also cebiche, seviche or sebiche, is a seafood dish typically made from fresh raw fish cured in citrus juices
      Lomo saltado | Thinly sliced beef steak, onions, tomatoes, french fries, soy sauce, rice, vinegar | Lomo saltado is a popular, traditional Peruvian dish, a stir fry that typically combines marinated strips of sirloin
      
  4. Build a page to **register an order**. Here the user can add a new order with its details and it can see a grid with the history of the orders. The grid should include the following columns (with example data): 
  
      Order Date | Restaurant Address | Dish Ordered | Client Gender | Dish Price
      --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
      January 19th 3:00 pm | Boulevard St. 45 | Lomo Saltado | Male | 20 USD
      January 21st 8:00 pm | Ocean Av. 38 | Ceviche | Female | 22 USD
  
  5. Build a page to show the **most popular dish by gender** (the most ordered ones)
  
### Extra points zone (not mandatory)

  * Feel free to make your own design for the UI.
